## Private Hostel Management Website
This website is developed to manage the availability of rooms in private hostels at our college. It allows hostel administrators to easily update vacancy counts and room details for each hostel.

## Features:
1. Admin Dashboard: A centralized control panel for hostel admins to manage room details, such as the total number of rooms, current occupancy, and vacancy count.
2. Hostel Listings: Displays a list of nearby private hostels with key details like location, vacancy count, and contact information.
3. Location Map: Shows the location of each hostel on an integrated map, allowing users to easily find the nearest hostels.
4. Ratings and Reviews: Each hostel has a rating system where students can leave reviews based on their experience, helping future residents make informed decisions.
5. Hostel Contact Information: Provides easy access to contact details (phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) for each hostel, making it easier for students to get in touch with the management.
6. Search and Filter: Allows users to search for hostels by location, fee range, vacancy status, and other filters to find the best match for their needs.
